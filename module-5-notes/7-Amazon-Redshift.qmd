# **Amazon Redshift**

Imagine a large retail company that collects data from various sources, such as sales transactions, customer feedback, inventory levels, and website interactions. This company needs to analyse all this data to understand customer behaviour, optimise inventory, and improve sales strategies. While they've used different storage solutions tailored to specific needs, they now face the challenge of quickly processing and analysing this massive volume of data to gain actionable insights. This is where Amazon Redshift can be useful.
