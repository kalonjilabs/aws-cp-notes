# **Amazon EC2 pricing**

AWS EC2 offers several pricing options to cater to different usage patterns and budgetary requirements. Here's an overview of each EC2 pricing model listed in your uploaded content:

### **On-Demand Instances**

On-Demand Instances allow you to pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60 seconds) with no long-term commitments or upfront payments. This option is ideal for applications with short-term, irregular workloads that cannot be interrupted. For example, they are perfect for developing and testing applications where you don't know the exact workload in advance.

### **Reserved Instances**

Reserved Instances provide you with the option to reserve EC2 computing capacity for 1 or 3 years, in exchange for a significantly discounted hourly rate (up to 75% compared to On-Demand pricing). This is suitable for applications with steady state or predictable usage and provides budget predictability. A common use case is for databases or enterprise applications where steady usage patterns are anticipated.

### **EC2 Instance Savings Plans**

Instance Savings Plans offer a way to save up to 72% on your computing costs, similar to Reserved Instances, but with more flexibility in how instances are utilized across the AWS environment. These plans apply to any EC2 instance family, region, and OS, making them ideal for users with shifting or unpredictable workloads but consistent overall usage.

### **Spot Instances**

Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud at steep discounts relative to On-Demand prices, up to 90% off. Spot Instances are perfect for workloads that are flexible in when they can run and can handle interruptions, such as batch data processing, background processing, or optional tasks.

### **Dedicated Hosts**

Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to your use. They help you address compliance requirements and reduce costs by allowing you to use your existing server-bound software licenses. These are particularly useful for regulatory requirements that may not support multi-tenant virtualization or for running software that has strict licensing terms that require dedicated physical servers.

Each pricing model is designed to meet different types of operational and financial needs, allowing businesses to optimize both performance and costs effectively. Depending on your workload requirements and how flexible you can be about when and how your applications run, you can choose the most cost-efficient way to use EC2.
