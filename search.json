    "text": "2.2 IT Deployment Models\nDeployment models in cloud computing can be likened to different types of housing arrangements:\n\n2.2.1 On-premises:\nLike owning a gated property—exclusive to one organisation, offering complete control and security for sensitive applications, meeting specific business needs.\nDeploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and providing resource management tools does not provide many of the benefits of cloud computing but is sometimes sought for its ability to provide dedicated resources. In most cases, this deployment model is the same as legacy IT infrastructure, while using application management and virtualization technologies to try and increase resource utilisation.\n\n\n2.2.2 Hybrid Cloud:\nIt combines elements of both, like owning a home but also renting additional space when needed. This setup allows keeping some servers on-premises while extending other capabilities to the cloud, providing flexibility and control over sensitive assets.\nA please visit hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud. The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organisation’s infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal systems.\n\n\n2.2.3 Cloud:\nSimilar to living in a high-rise apartment, resources are owned and operated by a third-party provider and shared across multiple customers over the internet, offering cost effectiveness and easy scalability.\nA cloud-based application is fully deployed in the cloud and all parts of the application run in the cloud. Applications in the cloud have either been created in the cloud or have been migrated from an existing infrastructure to take advantage of the benefits of cloud computing. Cloud-based applications can be built on low-level infrastructure pieces or can use higher level services that provide abstraction from the management, architecting, and scaling requirements of core infrastructure.",

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):\nProvides the basic building blocks for cloud IT, offering the highest level of flexibility—similar to leasing land on which to build whatever structure you need.\nInfrastructure as a Service (IaaS) contains the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provides access to networking features, computers (virtual or on dedicated hardware), and data storage space. Infrastructure as a Service vendors can help you with the highest level of flexibility and management control over your IT resources and are most similar to existing IT resources that many IT departments and developers are familiar with today.\n2. Platform as a Service (PaaS):\nEliminates the need to manage underlying infrastructure, focusing instead on the deployment and management of applications—like leasing a pre-built office space that you can customise.\nPlatforms as a service (PaaS) vendors remove the need for organisations to manage the underlying infrastructure (usually hardware and operating systems) and this integration allows you to focus on the deployment and management of your applications. This helps you be more efficient, as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.\n3. Software as a Service (SaaS):\nDelivers a complete product run and managed by the service provider—akin to subscribing to a streaming service.\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) vendors provide you with software applications that is run and managed by the vendor. In most cases, people referring to Software as a Service are referring to third-party end-user applications. With a SaaS offering you do not have to think about how the service is maintained or how the underlying infrastructure is managed; you only need to think about how you will use that particular piece of software. A common example of a SaaS application is web-based email where you can send and receive email without having to manage feature additions to the email product or maintaining the servers and operating systems that the email program is running on",

Here are the key factors:\n\nCompliance and Legal Requirements: Ensure data residency and sovereignty needs are met. This is like ensuring your business operations comply with local laws.\nProximity to Customers: Choose a region closest to your users to reduce the time it takes for data to travel, akin to opening a shop closer to your buyers to reduce delivery time.\nAvailable Services and Features: Not all regions have the same AWS services; newer services might be available in some regions first.\nPricing: Costs can vary from one region to another, just as the cost of living can vary from one country to another.\n\n\n3.3.1 AWS Availability Zones\nWithin each region, there are multiple Availability Zones (AZs). You can think of each AZ as a state or province within the “country” (region). Each AZ is made up of one or more data centers equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking to ensure fault tolerance and stability. They are interconnected with high-speed networking, enabling businesses to operate production applications and databases that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center.\n\n\n3.3.2 AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations)\nAWS Points of Presence or Edge Locations are like local post offices in towns. These are sites deployed in major cities and areas around the world to cache content closer to users, ensuring they receive data as quickly as possible. This system is part of AWS CloudFront, which helps in delivering content with lower latency.\n\n\n3.3.3 Tour of the AWS Console\nThe AWS Console is like the dashboard of a car, providing access to all the controls you need to manage your AWS services. It includes:\n\nGlobal Services: Services that are not specific to any region, like IAM (Identity and Access Management), Route 53 (a DNS web service), and CloudFront (a content delivery network).\nRegion-scoped Services: These are services that you can deploy in specific regions, like EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) for virtual servers, Lambda for serverless functions, or Elastic Beanstalk for deploying applications.",
